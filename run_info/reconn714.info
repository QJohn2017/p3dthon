! RUN_LIST.dat: Here we are trying to make a list of all of our runs that we will keep a talbe of information
! about each run. So when we load up a run it will know where to look for ever thing
! Currently this is our set up for how each line should be written. My Idea that to start we can
! by manualy enter in all this information and then develope software to do this when you enter
! a run that is not included.
!
! Some notes about this file:
!   ! is a comment and so the line is skipped when read in run.init
!   The @DEFF line is used to tell the run object what quantities it 
!       will need to make dictionary entries for. 
!   Blank lines and blank spaces are hopefully ingored
! Good luck and try not to change too much too quickly
